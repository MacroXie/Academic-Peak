# About the Units

### Unit 1: Primitive Types (2.5%-5%)

1. Primitive data types including `int`, `double`, and Boolean
2. Evaluating arithmetic expressions in program code
3. Using assignment operators to produce a value
4. How variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression a result

### Unit 2: Using Object (5%-7.5%)

1. Objects and classes as ways to describe instances, attributes, and behaviors
2. Creating objects by calling constructors with and without parameters
3. Utilizing class libraries, including `Integer`and `Double`
4. Defining an object’s behavior using methods, including static and `Math`class
5. Calling non-static void methods without parameters
6. Using String objects and methods
7. Using application program interfaces (APIs) and libraries

### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements (15%-17.5%)

1. Finding Boolean values with expressions involving relational operators
2. Using conditional statements to execute different statements based on input values
3. Building on conditional statements to create multiple possible outcomes
4. Creating the same value using equivalent Boolean expressions
5. Referencing objects with aliases

## Unit 4: Iteration (17.5%-22.5%)

1. Creating a loop to run an expression repeatedly until certain conditions are met
2. Standard arithmetic-based and `String` algorithms
3. Representing iterative processes in code using `for` and `while` loops
4. Nesting loop and iteration statements

### Unit 5: Writing Classes (5%-7.5%)

1. The make up of a class, including whether attributes are public or private
2. Setting an object’s attribute using constructors
3. Using comments to describe the functionality of code
4. Defining behaviors of an object using non-void, void, and static methods
5. Where variables can be used in program code
6. Breaking problems into smaller parts by creating methods to solve individual sub problems
7. Intellectual property and ethical concerns in programming

### Unit 6: Array (10%-15%)

1. Representing multiple related items as array objects
2. Traversing an array by accessing the elements using iteration statements
3. Standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to perform functions

### Unit 7: ArrayList (2.5%-7.5%)

1. Representing collections of related object reference data using `ArrayList` objects
2. Traversing an `ArrayList` by accessing the elements using iteration statements
3. Standard algorithms that utilize `ArrayList` traversals to perform functions
4. Searching and sorting using standard algorithms
5. Ethical issues around data collections

### Unit 8: 2D Arrey (7.5%-10%)

1. Representing collections of data as arrays of arrays, or 2D arrays
2. Traversing a 2D array by accessing the elements using nested iteration statements

### Unit 9: Inheritance (5%-10%)

1. Using common attributes and behaviors to group existing objects into superclasses
2. Defining and overriding methods within subclasses and superclasses
3. Creating references using inheritance hierarchies
4. Associating subclass objects with superclasses to create polymorphism

### Unit 10: Recursion (5%-7.5%)

1. Executing recursive methods
2. Searching and sorting using binary search and merge sort algorithms
